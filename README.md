## Description

This is the main repository for the Consulting Project: **"Quantification of Myogenic Differentiation using Deep Learning"**, developed at the [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) in partnership with [Musculoskeletal Center](https://www.lmu-klinikum.de/mum-lmu) at the LMU University Hospital.

## Supervisors and Project Partner

- Supervisors: [Prof. Dr. David RÃ¼gamer](https://www.m-datascience.mathematik-informatik-statistik.uni-muenchen.de/People/professors/ruegamer/index.html) and [Tobias Weber](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/people/weber/)

- Project Partner: [Dr. rer. nat. Maximilian Saller](https://www.lmu-klinikum.de/mum-lmu/287b7a2983b88c7a/e7ce030587e73f0c)

## Project Structure

1. [Main Repository](https://github.com/Noza23/myovision) (this repository)
   Contains notebooks for presentig main results of the project. Notebooks are located in the `notebooks` directory:

   - `01_predict_performance.ipynb`: Prediction and Performance Computation.
   - `02_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis
   - `03_classical_cv.ipynb`: Classical Computer Vision Techniques
   - `04_presentation_plots.ipynb`: Presentation Plots

2. [Data Collection](https://github.com/Noza23/myovision-data-utils)
   Contains scripts for collecting and preprocessing training data.
   For data annotation process we employed a specificly designed tool which is not public for now but we provide a visualization of the data annotation process:

   ```
   If you are interested in the Data Annotation Tool, please contact us.
   ```

3. [Model Training / Inference](https://github.com/Noza23/myovision-sam)
   Contains the modules for Training and Inference of segment-anything model for myotube segmentation and stardist model for nuclei segmentation.

   Visualisation of Inferece process in the designed tool:

   Contains the Final Report of the project.

5. [App Backend](https://github.com/Noza23/myovision-app)
   Contains the Backend of the Web Application.

6. [App Frontend](https://github.com/davitchanturia/myovision-app-front)
